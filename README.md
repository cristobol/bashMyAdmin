bashMyAdmin
===========

A collection of bash scripts to emulate PHPMYADMIN

Not knowing anything but Windows when it comes to computers, my attempts to learn about Linux and 
the command line have been interesting to say the least. I am a GUI-guy to my core, but I am trying hard 
to learn the command line and bash scripting. 

I have thus far always used PHPMYADMIN to manage the databases in my projects, but I thought that an interesting 
way to learn some bash scripting would be to try to create a collection of bash scripts that can completely replace 
the functions of PHPMYADMIN. Maybe this has been done before, but that doesn't matter to me, this is me learning 
how to create bash scripts and do so in a way that may be useful to me if it can get me away from using PHPMYADMIN 
and instead using the command line for database admin. 

If you see something you like, go ahead and take it. If you think you can help, welcome aboard.
